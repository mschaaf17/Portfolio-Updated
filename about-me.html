            <p class=""> Hello, thanks for stopping by this page. My name is Madison Schaaf. 
            </br>I am currently enrolled in a full stack coding bootcamp offered at the University of Utah.
            </br> 
            I have a Bachelors of Science in Psychology with a Masters of Education in Special Education. 
            </br>
            I have taught for the last 5 years and am looking to challenge myself in software development. I am currently learning full stack development to strengthen my skills in the tech industry.  
            </br>I have loved teaching for the last few years and am looking to expand my knowledge and challenge myself in other areas as well. I am hopeful to find a role where I can utilize my full stack development skills with a company that I can grow with.
